# This code snippet adds patterns of files that DVC should ignore,
# which can help improve the performance of DVC operations.
# 
# By ignoring certain files or directories, DVC can avoid unnecessary
# data transfers, file checks, and other operations that can slow down
# the overall performance of DVC.
# 
# The specific pattern used in this code is a URL pointing to the
# DVC ignore documentation, which provides more information on how
# to create and use ignore patterns with DVC.
# 
# To use this code, simply replace the URL with the desired ignore
# pattern or patterns, separated by newline characters.
# 
# For example, to ignore all files with the extension '.txt' and
# the 'temp' directory, the code would look like this:
# 
#     .txt
#     temp/
# 
# By adding these ignore patterns, DVC will skip any files or
# directories that match these patterns during its operations.
