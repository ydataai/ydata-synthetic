# What is Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data is artificially generated data that is not collected from real world events. It replicates the statistical components of real data without containing any identifiable information, ensuring individuals' privacy.

# Why Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data can be used for many applications:
- Privacy
- Remove bias
- Balance datasets
- Augment datasets

# ydata-synthetic
This repository contains material related with Generative Adversarial Networks for synthetic data generation, in particular regular tabular data and time-series.
It consists a set of different GANs architectures developed using Tensorflow 2.0. Several example Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts are included, to show how to use the different architectures.

# Quickstart

The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI).](https://pypi.org/project/ydata-synthetic/)
```
pip install ydata-synthetic
```

## Examples
Here you can find usage examples of the package and models to synthesize tabular data.

- Synthesizing the minority class with VanillaGAN on credit fraud dataset  [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/master/examples/regular/gan_example.ipynb)
- Time Series synthetic data generation with TimeGAN on stock dataset [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/master/examples/timeseries/TimeGAN_Synthetic_stock_data.ipynb)
- More examples are continously added and can be found in `/examples` directory.

### Datasets for you to experiment
Here are some example datasets for you to try with the synthesizers:
#### Tabular datasets
- [Adult census](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- [Credit card fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

#### Sequential datasets
- [Stock data](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/tree/master/data)
