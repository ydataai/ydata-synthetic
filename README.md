# YData Synthetic
A package to generate synthetic tabular and time-series data leveraging the state of the art generative models.

## ðŸŽŠ The exciting features:
> These are must try features when it comes to synthetic data generation:
  > - A new streamlit app that delivers the synthetic data generation experience with a UI interface. A low code experience for the quick generation of synthetic data
  > - A new fast synthetic data generation model based on Gaussian Mixture. So you can quickstart in the world of synthetic data generation without the need for a GPU.
  > - A conditional architecture for tabular data: CTGAN, which will make the process of synthetic data generation easier and with higher quality!
  
## Synthetic data
### What is synthetic data?
Synthetic data is artificially generated data that is not collected from real world events. It replicates the statistical components of real data without containing any identifiable information, ensuring individuals' privacy.

### Why Synthetic Data?
Synthetic data can be used for many applications:
  - Privacy compliance for data-sharing and Machine Learning development
  - Remove bias
  - Balance datasets
  - Augment datasets

# ydata-synthetic
This repository contains material related with architectures and models for synthetic data, from Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to Gaussian Mixtures.
The repo includes a full ecosystem for synthetic data generation, that includes different models for the generation of synthetic structure data and time-series.
All the Deep Learning models are implemented leveraging Tensorflow 2.0.
Several example Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts are included, to show how to use the different architectures.

Are you ready to learn more about synthetic data and the bext-practices for synthetic data generation?

## Quickstart
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic

Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python Package Index (PyPI).](https://pypi.org/project/ydata-synthetic/)
```commandline
pip install ydata-synthetic
```

### The UI guide for synthetic data generation

YData synthetic has now a UI interface to guide you through the steps and inputs to generate structure tabular data.
The streamlit app is available form *v1.0.0* onwards, and supports the following flows:
- Train a synthesizer model
- Generate & profile synthetic data samples

#### Installation

```commandline
pip install ydata-synthetic[streamlit]
```
#### Quickstart
Use the code snippet below in a python file (Jupyter Notebooks are not supported):
```python
from ydata_synthetic import streamlit_app

streamlit_app.run()
```

Or use the file streamlit_app.py that can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/tree/master/examples/streamlit_app.py).

```commandline
python -m streamlit_app
```

The below models are supported:
  - CGAN
  - WGAN
  - WGANGP
  - DRAGAN
  - CRAMER
  - CTGAN
