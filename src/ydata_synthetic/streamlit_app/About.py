    ##### What you should ensure before training the synthesizer:
    - Make sure your dataset has no missing data. 
        - If missing data is a problem, no worries. Check the article and this article. 
    - Make sure you choose the right number of epochs and batch_size considering your dataset shape. 
        - The choice of these 2 parameters highly affects the results you may get. 
    - Make sure that you've the right data types selected. 
        - Only numerical and categorical values are supported.
        - In case date , datetime, or text is available in the dataset, the columns should be preprocessed before the model training.''')
