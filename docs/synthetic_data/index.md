# Synthetic data generation

[Synthetic data](https://ydata.ai/products/synthetic_data) is data that has been created artificially through computer simulation or that algorithms can generate to
take the place of real-world data. The data can be used as an alternative or supplement to real-world data when real-world
data is not readily available. It can also be used as a Machine Learning performance booster.

The ydata-sdk package is a Python package developed by YDataâ€™s team that allows users to easily benefit from Generative AI
and generate synthetic data. The main goal of the package is to serve as a way for data
scientists to get familiar with synthetic data and its applications in real-world domains, as well as the potential of **Generative AI**.

The *ydata-sdk* package provides different methods for generating synthetic tabular, time-series data as well as databases.

The package also aims to facilitate the exploration and understanding of synthetic data generation methods!
