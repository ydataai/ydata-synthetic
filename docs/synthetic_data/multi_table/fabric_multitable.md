Multitable synthetic data enables the creation of large, diverse
datasets crucial for training robust machine learning models, algorithm testing, and addressing privacy concerns. It can be
crucial to enable proper data democratization within an organization. 

Nevertheless, the process of generating a full database or even several tables that share relations, can be particularly
challenging due to the necessity of preserving referential integrity across diverse tables and scale. This involves maintaining
realistic relationships between entities to mirror real-world scenarios accurately while being able to process large volumes
of data.

[YData Fabric](https://ydata.ai/products/fabric) offers a cutting-edge Synthetic data generation process that seamlessly integrates with your existing Relational databases.
By replicating the data's value and structure to a new target storage, Fabric delivers a wide range of benefits and use-cases.
These include reducing risk and improving compliance by substituting operational databases with synthetic databases for tests and development. It also enables QA teams to create comprehensive and more flexible testing scenarios.
