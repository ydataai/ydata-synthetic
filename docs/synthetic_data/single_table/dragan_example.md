# Synthesize tabular data

!!! note "Outdated"
    Note that this example won't work with the latest version of `ydata-synthetic`. 

    Please check `ydata-sdk` to see [how to generate synthetic data](https://docs.fabric.ydata.ai/latest/sdk/examples/synthesize_tabular_data/).

**Using *DRAGAN* to generate tabular synthetic data:**

Real-world domains are often described by **tabular data** i.e., data that can be structured and organized in a table-like format, where **features/variables** are represented in **columns**, whereas **observations** correspond to the **rows**.

DRAGAN is a GAN variant that uses a gradient penalty to improve training stability and mitigate mode collapse:

Hereâ€™s an example of how to synthetize tabular data with DRAGAN using the [Adult Census Income](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income?resource=download) dataset:
