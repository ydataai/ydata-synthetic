# Synthesize tabular data

**Using *CGAN* to generate tabular synthetic data:**

Real-world domains are often described by **tabular data** i.e., data that can be structured and organized in a table-like format, where **features/variables** are represented in **columns**, whereas **observations** correspond to the **rows**.

CGAN is a deep learning model that combines GANs with conditional models to generate data samples based on specific conditions:

Hereâ€™s an example of how to synthetize tabular data with CGAN using the [Credit Card](https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=1597&status=active) dataset:
